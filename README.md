↳ DESCRIPTION ༉‧₊

###
One kind of flowchart used to show how systems or programs operate is the block diagram. They are made up of interlocking blocks that stand in for various system parts or operations. A function is represented by each block, and the arrows that link them show how information or control moves between them.

The method of creating a block diagram is locating the essential parts or procedures inside a system and representing them as boxes or blocks. Usually, each box stands for a distinct activity or function that enhances the system's overall functionality. The data or control flow between the various components can then be shown by joining these blocks together with arrows or lines.
